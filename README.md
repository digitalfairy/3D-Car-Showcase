## ✨ Project Showcase & Technical Focus

This application serves as a technical demonstration of modern 3D web development:

* **High-Fidelity Vehicle Rendering:** Optimized loading and material application for complex GLB/GLTF car models (Tesla Model 3, Semi, and Cybertruck).
* **Cinematic Transitions:** Implementation of smooth, state-driven camera movements that transition the user through distinct environmental "stages."
* **Advanced Post-Processing:** Utilizes `@react-three/postprocessing` to implement **Bloom**, **SSR (Screen Space Reflections)**, and **Depth of Field** for a realistic automotive showroom feel.
* **Environment Logic:** A modular system for swapping HDRIs, lighting setups, and ground reflections dynamically using **Jotai** state.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Expertise

* **Graphics Core:** **Three.js / React Three Fiber (R3F)** – *Scene management, PBR materials, and real-time shadows.*
* **Helpers:** **@react-three/drei** – *Camera controls, environment presets, and model optimization.*
* **Debugging:** **Leva** – *Real-time GUI for fine-tuning lighting and post-processing variables.*
* **State Management:** **Jotai** – *Atomic state for handling active scene indices and transition triggers.*
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** – *Responsive overlay UI for navigation and vehicle stats.*

# 🏞️ 3D Slideshow - Three.js & React Three Fiber

## Project Overview

This project features a smooth and immersive **3D Slideshow** that transitions seamlessly between distinct 3D scenes. The core goal is to showcase an elegant method for managing multiple, complex 3D environments on the web.

The application leverages **React's component model** to build 3D scenes using **React Three Fiber (R3F)**, resulting in highly performant and maintainable code.

### Key Features:

* **Seamless 3D Transitions:** Smooth camera and visual effects between scenes.
* **Modular Scene Architecture:** Easy to add, modify, or swap out 3D environments.
* **React Three Fiber (R3F):** Utilized for declarative 3D scene creation.
* **Post-Processing Effects:** Includes effects like bloom or depth-of-field for cinematic visuals.
* **State Management:** Simple, primitive state handling with **Jotai**.
